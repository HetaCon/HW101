    <div id="description"><p>Hey hey hey! I'm Stanley Parable, or Stan for short! I'm a genderfluid artist who uses he/she/they pronouns,
        and I currently am a senior at UCI.
    </p>

    <p>I'm hoping to become a freelance artist who sells their work at fan conventions as I am a big fan of anime and the occassional video game,
        and a good majority of my art is of my favorite characters. My favorite anime currently is <b>Haikyuu!!</b> and I've recently been playing
        <b>Persona 5 Royal</b> and <b>Breath of the Wild</b>. My younger sister is much more of a fan of video games than I am though, I'm pretty terrible when it comes
        to real-time combat in particular and while I do enjoy figuring out strategies and puzzles of some games, I more often than not will look up guides.
        For me, it's more about the story rather than the mechanics, though that makes sense given my interest in psychology and psychoanalysis. I did for a little bit
        consider minoring in psychology when transferring from community college, but it`s really more of a casual interest and not something I intend to pursue career-wise.
    </p>

    <p>My work is the way in which I have learned to process the things going on in my life and try to figure them out, whether it looks like it or not.
        Sure, sometimes a piece is just of an eccentric high school artist who's dressed like a fox and is wielding a katana against shadows in the Metaverse,
        but it's about his story arc of learning to stand up to even the people he admired and his struggles with art block and inspiration that I chose to draw him.
    </p>

    <p>In the end, I think people should just be unafraid to live their truth. It can be hard, I won't deny it, but spending all the time we have worrying about
        what other people think of us is a waste of time when there's so much out there to do. That's something I try to remember anyways.
